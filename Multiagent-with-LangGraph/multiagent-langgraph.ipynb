Social media platforms serve as popular venues for sharing experiences, seeking information, and offering peer-to-peer support among individuals living with mental illness. Many individuals with mental disorders use these platforms for mental health information, for connecting with mental health providers, and accessing evidence-based mental health services [1].\\n\\n2. Prolonged use of social media platforms, such as Facebook, may be associated with negative signs and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. However, other studies found no relationship between the time spent on social media and depression or between social media-related activities such as the number of online friends and the number of “selfies”, and depression [5].\\n\\n3. Negative impacts such as depressive symptoms, poor sleep quality, reduced sleep duration, and sleep difficulties have been linked to social media use [4,5].\\n\\nCollective effects:\\n\\n1. Social media can facilitate social interaction and connect individuals with supportive peers, potentially augmenting existing mental health programs and services [1].\\n\\n2. On the negative side, fear of missing out (FOMO) due to social media use is reported to moderately to seriously affect 14.4% of adolescents, indicating a collective challenge among the youth population [4].\\n\\nMacroeconomic effects:\\n\\n1. Mental health issues associated with social media can lead to productivity loss, increased healthcare costs, and reduced quality of life. Conversely, if social media can be effectively harnessed to improve mental health services, it could potentially lower healthcare costs and improve societal productivity [1,2,3].\\n\\n2. Despite encouraging progress, large evidence gaps exist regarding the economic case for many areas of mental health treatment and care, suggesting that the macroeconomic effects of social media on mental health require further research and understanding [3].\\n\\nReferences:\\n[1] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7785056/\\n[2] https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20211218\\n[3] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6953559/\\n[4] https://zipdo.co/statistics/social-media-mental-health/\\n[5] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7364393/', name='Economist')], 'sender': 'Economist'}}\n",
